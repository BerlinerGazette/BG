This plugin allows you to easily add a Flattr donation buttons to your blog and blog posts.

== Description ==

Flattr was founded to help people share money, not only content. Before Flattr, the only reasonable way to donate has been to use Paypal or other systems to send money to people. The threshold for this is quite high. People would just ignore sending donations if it wasn't for a really important cause. Sending just a small sum has always been a pain in the ass. Who would ever even login to a payment system just to donate €0.01? And €10 was just too high for just one blog entry we liked...

Flattr solves this issue. When you're registered to flattr, you pay a small monthly fee. You set the amount yourself. In the end of the month, that fee is divided between all the things you flattered. You're always logged in to the account. That means that giving someone some flattr-love is just a button away. And you should! Clicking one more button doesn't add to your fee. It just divides the fee between more people! Flattr tries to encourage people to share. Not only pieces of content, but also some money to support the people who created them. With love! 

**Flattr requires an account at flattr.com!**

2. Go to the WordPress control panel and find the 'Plugins' section

6. Live long and prosper. :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcode? =

The shortcode is [flattr url="http://example.com/"]. It has many attributes but the url attribute is the only one required.

Supported attributes are:

* **url** - the URL that should be flattred. *Required*
* **type** - overrides the default setting of the button style to use. Can be either "js", "compact", "text", "image" or "url".
* **popout** - overrides the default setting on whether the popout should be shown. Should be either "yes" or "no".

Additional autosubmit related attributes:

* **user** - the username of the user owning the thing - needed for autosubmits.
* **hidden** - overrides the default setting on whether an autosubmit of the thing should be hidden. Should be either "yes" or "no".
* **language** - overrides the blog language as the language of an autosubmit of the thing. Should be a language code like en_GB.
* **category** - overrides the default category for an autosubmit of the thing. Should be one of the [supported ones](http://developers.flattr.net/api/resources/categories/).
* **title** - the title used in an autosubmit of the thing.
* **description** - the description used in an autosubmit of the thing.
* **tags** - a comma separated list of tags that's used in an autosubmit of the thing.

For options that use "yes" or "no" you can instead of "no" use "n" or "off" - any other value will be interpreted as "yes".
