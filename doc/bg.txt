# Centered Descriptions for Categories

If you want to display a blog-post like description for the current category page in the archive or in the website, just create a new Page with the title of the category with a "_Center" at the end.

# Category Description in the Sidebar

Same like the centered description just add "_Sidebar" as the name.

# Tag Description Pages

Itâ€™s possible to create Pages for Tags as well. They are displayed in the right sidebar and should be named `[Tag]_TagSidebar` or `[Tag]_Sidebar`.
